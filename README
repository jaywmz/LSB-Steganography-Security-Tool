# LSB Steganography

This is a Python script for a GUI application that performs Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography. It uses the Tkinter library for the GUI and the PIL library for image manipulation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Python 3.6 or later.
- You have installed the following Python libraries: `tkinter`, `PIL`, `numpy`, `opencv`, and `tkinterdnd2`.

You can install the necessary libraries with pip:
```sh
pip install pillow numpy tkinterdnd2 opencv-python
```

## Running LSB Steganography

Open a terminal in the directory containing `encoder_main.py` and `decoder_main.py`.

To test the encode functionality, run the following command:
```sh
python encoder_main.py
```

To test the decode functionality, run the following command:
```sh
python decoder_main.py
```

The GUI will open.

### For Encoding:

1. Select a cover file (an image or video file).
2. Select a payload file (a text file).
3. Select the number of least significant bits to use for the steganography.
4. Click "Encode" to hide the payload in the cover file. The steganographic file will be saved and displayed in the GUI.

### For Decoding:

1. Select a stego file (an image or video file with hidden data).
2. Select the number of least significant bits used for encoding.
3. Click "Decode" to extract the hidden data from the stego file.

## Using the GUI

- **Select Cover File**: Choose the image or video file you want to use to hide the message.
- **Select Payload File**: Choose the text file containing the message you want to hide.
- **Number of LSBs**: Select the number of least significant bits to use for the encoding.
- **Encode**: Click to encode the message into the cover file.
- **Select Stego File**: Choose the stego image or video file to decode the hidden message.
- **Decode**: Click to extract the hidden message from the stego file.
