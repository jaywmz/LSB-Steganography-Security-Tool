LSB Steganography
This is a Python script for a GUI application that performs Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography. It uses the Tkinter library for the GUI and the PIL library for image manipulation.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed Python 3.6 or later.
- You have installed the following Python libraries: tkinter, PIL, numpy, and tkinterdnd2.

You can install the necessary libraries with pip:
- pip install pillow numpy tkinterdnd2

To run LSB Steganography, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal in the directory containing lsb_steganography.py.
2. Run the script with the following command:
- python lsb_steganography.py
3. The GUI will open. You can select a cover file (an image file), a payload file (a text file), and the number of least significant bits to use for the steganography.
4. Click "Encode" to hide the payload in the cover image. The steganographic image will be saved as stego_image.png and displayed in the GUI.
You can also select a stego file (an image file with hidden data) and click "Decode" to extract the hidden data.
